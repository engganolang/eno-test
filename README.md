# Enggano test repository

This is a test repository for the Enggano language 
[project](https://enggano.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk). The primary aims are:

- testing how to manage multiple GitHub accounts in a single computer 
(this `engganolang` account and a project member's [personal 
account](https://github.com/gederajeg))
- practicing pull request (e.g., from personal GitHub account to this 
`engganolang` account)
